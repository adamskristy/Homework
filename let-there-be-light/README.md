- Create a folder with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Your goal is to create a button that mimics a light switch.
- The initial image should be a lightbulb that is OFF. When the user clicks the button, the lightbulb should turn on (switch images) and vice versa.
- Besides switching the image, make the ON/OFF button cause at least 3 other visual changes to the page. (Example: - Changing the background from black to white)
- Use Flex Box or Grid in some way (Example: Centering elements on the page)
